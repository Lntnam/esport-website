I have to build this website for my DOTA 2 team, and I was thinking this may be exactly what you're needing for yours too.

The website is built on Laravel 5.3 and Bootstrap 3 hence you should know a thing or two about how to launch a Laravel-based project.

Maybe suitable for other esports as well.
